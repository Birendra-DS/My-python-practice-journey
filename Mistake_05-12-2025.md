# len() function
1️⃣ Why len(a) is wrong here
In my code:
output5 = True if len(a) % 2 == 0 and len(a) <= 10 else False

a is an int (I can do %, comparisons, etc. with it).
len() only works on sequences/collections (string, list, tuple, dict, set, etc.), not plain numbers. So len(a) on an int raises:
TypeError: object of type 'int' has no len()

To count digits of an integer, you must convert it:
digits = len(str(abs(a)))  # number of digits in a
output5 = (digits % 2 == 0) and (digits <= 10)

So,len() works for any object that has a length defined, for example:
strings: len("hello") # 5
lists: len([1, 2, 3]) # 3

tuples, sets, dicts, ranges, many library objects, and custom classes that define __len__.
Just not plain numbers like int, float, bool, complex.
