# len() function
1️⃣ Why len(a) is wrong here
In my code:
output5 = True if len(a) % 2 == 0 and len(a) <= 10 else False

a is an int (I can do %, comparisons, etc. with it).
len() only works on sequences/collections (string, list, tuple, dict, set, etc.), not plain numbers. So len(a) on an int raises:
TypeError: object of type 'int' has no len()

To count digits of an integer, you must convert it:
digits = len(str(abs(a)))  # number of digits in a
output5 = (digits % 2 == 0) and (digits <= 10)

So,len() works for any object that has a length defined, for example:
strings: len("hello") # 5
lists: len([1, 2, 3]) # 3

tuples, sets, dicts, ranges, many library objects, and custom classes that define __len__.
Just not plain numbers like int, float, bool, complex.


# More python version of chaining assigment
For this specific exercise (which explicitly wants both steps), my structure is already reasonable. If this were not an exercise and you only cared about the final result, a simpler expression would be:

python
def chaining(a, b, c):
    x = y = z = c
    return x, y, z
This skips the intermediate copying because we only care that all three variables end up with the value of c.

 ## Why the suggestions are better
The shorter version reduces “noise” — fewer lines means fewer places for bugs and less to read.

Directly showing x = y = z = c highlights what matters: all three share the same value, taken from c.

Avoiding unnecessary intermediate steps is a common professional habit; it keeps logic obvious and easier to maintain.

For your assignment, though, keep your two‑step version, because it matches the instructions exactly and demonstrates that you understand both copying and chained assignment.
Your code with clearer comments
python
def chaining(a, b, c):
    # Step 1: copy input values into x, y, z
    x = a      # x gets the value of a
    y = b      # y gets the value of b
    z = c      # z gets the value of c

    # Step 2: chained assignment
    # make x, y, z all equal to the current value of z (which is c)
    x = y = z

    # Step 3: return the final values
    return x, y, z
Notice how each comment explains the purpose of the line, not just re‑writing the code in English.

## Suggestions for naming, comments, structure
Naming: here, a, b, c and x, y, z are fine because the question itself uses them. In real code, prefer descriptive names like first, second, third, or original, copy1, copy2.

Comments:
Explain why something is done: “make all variables share the same value” is more helpful than “chained assignment”.
Keep comments short and aligned with logical steps, not every single line.

Structure:
Group related lines with a blank line between major steps (you already do this logically with the two stages).
Try to keep a simple top‑to‑bottom story: “copy inputs → apply chained assignment → return result”.

## Habit to avoid issues in future
Adopt this small habit:
Before writing code, say in plain language what each variable should represent and what each step should achieve. Then check your code against that sentence.

### For example:
“First, x should equal a, y should equal b, z should equal c. Then I want all three to become equal to the original value of c.”
After coding, read each line and ask: “Does this line still match that sentence?”
This habit catches unnecessary steps, wrong assignments, and confusing names early.

## Professional style
Clean, direct code is easier for teammates (or your future self) to understand and maintain.
Many coding guidelines say: don’t keep variables or steps you don’t actually need.
For learning / exams: your longer version is perfect because it shows you understand the steps.
For real projects: you’d probably write the shorter one.
